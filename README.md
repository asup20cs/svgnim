## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Linux (Recommended)

This project includes a setup script to automate the installation process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/asup20cs/svgnim.git
    cd svgnim
    ```

2.  **Run the setup script:**
    This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.
    ```sh
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment and run the GUI:**
    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python gui.py
    ```
